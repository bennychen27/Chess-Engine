# Chess-Engine Project

## 1. Project Overview
A chess engine in which the user has the option to play versus another play locally, against a computer, or spectate computer versus computer. The AI utilizes the 
Mini-Max algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to predict the best optimal move at a specified decision tree depth. The chess engine follows the chess rules such as 
en-passant, castling, checkmate/check, stalemate conditions, and pawn promotion. </br>

Also includes additional features that allow the user to undo a move, reset the board,
flip the board,
